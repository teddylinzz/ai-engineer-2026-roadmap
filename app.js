      question: "Explain how the KV Cache speeds up inference. Deduce the exact space complexity formula to store the KV Cache for a Llama-3-8B model under a batch size of 8 and sequence length of 2048 in FP16 precision.",
      answer: "<h4>Model Answer & Analysis</h4>\n<p>During autoregressive decoding, the model generates one token at a time. Without caching, the attention layers must recompute key and value vectors for all historical tokens at every single generation step, resulting in O(N²) computation. The <strong>KV Cache</strong> stores these computed Key and Value vectors in GPU memory, reducing the computation per step to O(N).</p>\n\n<h4>Space Complexity Calculation:</h4>\n<p>The memory size of the KV cache is determined by:</p>\n<p style='text-align:center;'><code>Memory (bytes) = 2 · B · L · H · D · P</code></p>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><code>2</code>: Represents separate caches for Keys and Values.</li>\n  <li><code>B</code>: Batch size (8).</li>\n  <li><code>L</code>: Number of transformer layers. (For Llama 3 8B, <code>L = 32</code>).</li>\n  <li><code>H</code>: Number of Key/Value attention heads. Note that Llama 3 uses <strong>Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)</strong> where the number of KV heads is 8, while query heads is 32. So <code>H_kv = 8</code>.</li>\n  <li><code>D</code>: Dimension size of each head (For Llama 3 8B, <code>D = 128</code>).</li>\n  <li><code>P</code>: Precision bytes. For FP16, <code>P = 2</code> bytes.</li>\n  <li><code>seq_len</code>: Sequence context length (2048).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plugging in the Llama 3 8B numbers:</p>\n<p style='font-family: monospace; background:#000; padding:10px; border-radius:5px;'>Bytes = 2 * 8 * 32 * 8 * 128 * 2 * 2048 = 2,147,483,648 bytes = 2.15 GB</p>\n<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Under FP16 precision, the KV Cache requires 2.15 GB of VRAM.
